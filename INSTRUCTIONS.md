# Hierarchical Routing Implementation Guide

## Overview of Required Tasks

### Data Preparation & H3 Indexing
You will be working with two datasets located in the `datasets/` directory:
- `osmnetwork_edges.gpkg`: Road network edges (linestrings with attributes)
- `osmnetwork_nodes.gpkg`: Road network nodes (points with identifiers)

Your tasks include:
1. Loading datasets using Python (via geopandas)
2. Assigning edges to H3 cells at a chosen resolution
3. Creating and storing edge-to-H3 cell mappings

### Meta-Network Construction
After mapping edges to H3 cells:
1. Identify all unique H3 cells covering your network
2. Create a meta-network using H3 cells as nodes
3. Establish adjacency between H3 cells
4. Apply optional attribute-based filtering
5. Assign weights to meta-network edges

### Hierarchical Routing Implementation
Given start and end coordinates:
1. Encode locations to H3 cells
2. Find meta-network path (coarse path)
3. Extract relevant road network subset
4. Snap endpoints to network nodes
5. Compute final shortest path
6. Compare with direct routing performance

### Optional Enhancements
- Precompute shortest paths between neighboring H3 cell centroids
- Create visualizations of meta-network and routes
- Experiment with resolution and filtering strategies

## Deliverables

### Required Scripts
All scripts should be written in Python:

#### 1. `assign_h3_to_network.py`
- Reads `osmnetwork_edges.gpkg`
- Assigns edges to H3 cells
- Outputs mapping (CSV/GeoPackage)

#### 2. `build_meta_network.py`
- Constructs H3 cell meta-network
- Determines cell adjacency
- Applies filters
- Exports network representation

#### 3. `hierarchical_route.py`
Implements:
- Source/target H3 encoding
- Meta-route computation
- Subgraph extraction
- Endpoint snapping
- Final path computation
- Result output

### Data Outputs
- Edge-to-H3 cell mapping dataset
- Meta-network representation file
- Example routing outputs

### Documentation
Text files (`.md` or `.pdf`) explaining:
- H3 resolution selection rationale
- Meta-network construction approach
- Performance comparison analysis

## Implementation Guide

### Step 1: Environment Setup
Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries:
  - geopandas
  - h3
  - networkx
- Datasets in `datasets/` folder

### Step 2: H3 Cell Assignment
In `assign_h3_to_network.py`:

1. Load edge data:
```python
edges = geopandas.read_file('datasets/osmnetwork_edges.gpkg')
```

2. Process each edge:
- Extract geometry
- Sample points along edge
- Convert to H3 cells
- Store unique cell associations

3. Output considerations:
- Choose between CSV or GeoPackage format
- Handle multi-cell edge assignments
- Consider edge sampling strategy

### Step 3: Meta-Network Construction
In `build_meta_network.py`:

1. Process H3 cells:
- Collect unique cells
- Determine cell adjacency using `h3.k_ring()` or `h3.grid_disk()`
- Apply optional filtering

2. Edge weight assignment:
- Calculate centroid distances
- Create networkx graph structure

3. Output options:
- CSV format: `source_h3, target_h3, weight`
- GraphML using networkx

### Step 4: Hierarchical Routing
In `hierarchical_route.py`:

1. Input processing:
- Convert coordinates to H3 cells
- Execute meta-network shortest path
- Extract relevant subgraph

2. Path computation:
- Snap endpoints to network
- Calculate final shortest path
- Generate output format

3. Performance considerations:
- Efficient geometry handling
- Algorithm selection
- Output format optimization

### Step 5: Analysis
Compare and document:
- Full network vs. hierarchical routing performance
- Implementation complexity
- Resource usage

## Optional Enhancements

### Advanced Features
1. Shortest path precomputation:
- Calculate actual network paths between cell centroids
- Store results for meta-network weights

2. Visualization options:
- Use matplotlib/geoplot/folium
- Display meta-network structure
- Show routing results
